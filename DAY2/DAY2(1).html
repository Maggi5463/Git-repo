<h2><u>Early political career</u></h2>
<p><i>Yogi Adityanath</i> belongs to a specific tradition of <em>Hindutva politics</em> in Uttar Pradesh that can be traced back to the Mahant Digvijay Nath, who led the placing of idols in the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 22 December 1949.[28][29] Both Digvijay Nath and his successor Avaidyanath belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha and were elected to the Parliament on that party's ticket. After the BJP and the Sangh Parivar joined the Ayodhya movement in the 1980s, the two strands of Hindu nationalism came together. Avaidyanath switched to the BJP in 1991, but nevertheless maintained significant autonomy. Four years after Adityanath was designated Avaidyanath's successor, he was elected to the Lower House of the Indian Parliament (the Lok Sabha).[28]</p>

<p>In January 2007, Adityanath with other <del>BJP leaders</del> had gathered to mourn the death of a man who was killed because of religious violence. He and his supporters were subsequently arrested by the police and lodged in Gorkhapur jail on the charges of disturbing peace and violating prohibitory orders.<mark> His arrest led to further unrest during which several coaches of the Mumbai bound Mumbai–Gorakhpur Godan Express were burnt, allegedly by protesting Hindu Yuva Vahini activists.</mark>[35][36][37] The day after the arrest, the District Magistrate and the local police chief were transferred and replaced.[38]</p>

<h3><u>Relations with the BJP</u></h3>
<p><small>In March 2010, Adityanath was one of several BJP MPs who defied the party whip on the Women's Reservation Bill in the Parliament.[48][49]</small></P>
