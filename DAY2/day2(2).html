<h1><u><center>Osama bin Laden</center></u></h1>
<p><b>Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden</b> (Arabic: <del>أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن,</del> romanized: <i>Usāma bin Muḥammad bin</i> ʿ<em>Awaḍ bin Lādin</em>; 10 March 1957 – 2 May 2011) was a Saudi-born Islamic dissident and militant leader who was the founder and first general emir of al-Qaeda from 1988 until his death in 2011. Ideologically a pan-Islamist, he participated in the Afghan Jihad against the Soviet Union and supported the activities of the Bosnian mujahideen during the Yugoslav Wars. <strong>Bin Laden is most widely known as the mastermind of the September 11 attacks in the United States.</strong></p>

<h2><ins>Name</ins></h2>
<p>He was named Usama, meaning "lion", after<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usama_ibn_Zayd"> Usama ibn Zayd</a>, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companions_of_the_Prophet">companions</a> of Muhammad.[7] Osama bin Laden had assumed the kunya (teknonym) Abū ʿAbdallāh, meaning "father of Abdallah" The Arabic linguistic convention would be to refer to him as "Osama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "Bin Laden" alone, as "Bin Laden" is a patronymic, not a surname in the Western manner. According to one of his sons Omar, the family's hereditary surname is āl-Qaḥṭānī, but Bin Laden's father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Ladin">Mohammed bin Laden,</a> never officially registered the name.[8]</p>

<h3><ins>Early attacks and aid for attacks</ins></h3>
<p>It is believed that the<mark> first bombing attack involving Bin Laden was the 29 December 1992,</mark> bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden in which two people were killed.[103]</p>
<p>After this bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to<del> Jannah </del>(paradise) if they were good Muslims and to Jahannam (hell) if they were bad or non-believers.[141]<mark> The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.</mark></P>

<h4><ins>Late 1990s attacks</ins></h4>
<p><small>It has been claimed that Bin Laden funded the Luxor massacre of 17 November 1997,[143][144][145] which killed 62 civilians, and outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing Bin Laden to abandon his Najim Jihad compound and move his operations to Tarnak Farms in the south.[146]</small></P>
