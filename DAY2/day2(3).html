<p><b>Adolf Hitler</b>[a] (<i>20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945</i>) was an Austrian-born <strong>German politician</strong> who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 <em>until his suicide in 1945.</em> He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[c] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[d] <mark>During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939.</mark> He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the genocide of about <del>six million Jews and millions of other victims.</del></p>
<h2><u>Ancestry</u></h2>
<p><b>Hitler's father.</b>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Hitler">Alois Hitler</a></i> (1837–1903), was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)">illegitimate</a> child of Maria Anna Schicklgruber.[4] The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname, "Schicklgruber". In 1842,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Hiedler"> Johann Georg Hiedler</a> married Alois's mother. Alois was brought up in the family of <del>Hiedler's brother</del>, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler.[5]<mark> In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as "Georg Hitler").[6][7] Alois then assumed the surname "Hitler",[7] also spelled "Hiedler", "Hüttler", or "Huettler".</mark> The name is probably based on the German word Hütte<sup> (lit. 'hut')</sup>, and probably has the meaning "one who lives in a hut".[8]</P>

<h3><ins>Early years</ins></h3>
<p><b>Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889</b> in Braunau am Inn, a town in <i>Austria-Hungary</i> (present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire.[14][15] <Strong>He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Pölzl.</strong> Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.[16]<em> Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage</em>: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[17] When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany.[18] There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[19][20][21] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees.<mark> Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[22][23]</mark>
Hitler as an infant (c. 1889–90)The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[24]<del> His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.</del>[25]
